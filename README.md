# hello, Crimson!
Welcome to The Harvard Crimson! We just want you to get familiar with Git, so this is a very simple assignment to verify that you are present!

In order to submit this assignment, all you will have to do is add a bit of info about yourself below, then run the commands after to submit.

(simple responses only please, no crazy long sentences, and definitely no multi-line sentences!)

### Information
1. Favorite Color: TODO
2. Favorite Food: TODO
3. Favorite Movie: TODO

-----

After you've filled in the above spaces (wherever you see "TODO"), you'll want to open a Terminal or Bash or Console (hacker-type black screen with letters), and navigate to the repository (also called a directory or a folder) where you've been editing this file (where does this file live on your computer?). For example, if this repository lives in your downloads folder (aka directory), then you might type:
```
cd ~/Downloads/hello-world
```
Which means "change directory" to the folder _hello-world_. Then comes the Git magic:
```
git add README.md
git commit -m "I submitted my first assignment!"
git push
```
We'll be around to debug errors if you have them, but the lowdown is: _git add_ tells Git to track the file, _git commit_ takes all the changes you made and prepares them to get submitted to Github's servers, and _git push_ pushes all those juicy new files over to Github.

Congratulations! First assignment submitted!
